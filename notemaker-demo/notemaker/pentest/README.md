To run container specific pentests:

0. put ./scripts into your PATH
1. deploy application by navigating to deploy folder and run "initialDeploy 1.0"
2. run "show svc -w" and wait for notemaker service IP to get populated
3. use your browser to browse to IP listed in web-service
4. create at least one note, check results on console runtime radar
5. in pentest folder run "setAllModelsToActive" (IMPORTANT!!!)
6. create a CNAF firewall rule in alert mode to protect notemaker/web-svc*, make sure "SQLinj attack"  is checked
7. run runPentest from this folder (pentest)

NOTE: all tests will fail and create alerts in Prisma Cloud Console until you add prevention
