To run container specific pentests:

0. put ./scripts into your PATH
1. deploy application by navigating to deploy folder and run "initialDeploy 1.0"
2. run "show svc -w" and wait for notemaker service IP to get populated
3. use your browser to browse to IP listed in web-service
4. create at least one note, check results on console runtime radar
5. in pentest folder run "setAllModelsToActive" (IMPORTANT!!!) - this requires python3 installed and linked to python
   if you can't get python3 setup and working, just use console UI to make all notemaker/* models active
6. create a CNAF firewall rule in alert mode to protect notemaker/web-svc*, make sure "SQLinj attack"  is checked
7. run runPentest from this folder or alternatively run containerPentest or webPentest

NOTE: all attacks will be successful and create alerts in Prisma Cloud Console until you add prevention or blocking
